           <h2>Delegated Proof of Stake</h2>
           <h3>by Daniel Larimer on April 3, 2014</h3>
           <p>
         This paper introduces a new implementation of proof of stake that can validate transactions 
         in seconds while providing greater security in a shorter period of time than all existing proof 
         of stake systems.  In the time it takes Bitcoin to produce a single block a DPOS system can 
         have your transaction verified by 20% of the shareholders and by the time Bitcoin claims the 
         transaction is almost irreversible (6 blocks, 1 hour) your transaction under DPOS has been 
         verified by 100% of the shareholders through their representatives.

           <h2>The end of Cryptomoney</h2>
           <h3>by Charles Evans on March 25, 2014</h3>
           <p>
           2014-03-25 the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued its long-awaited <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf">guidance</a> on how to categorize cryptocurrencies for tax reporting in the USA.   The IRS declared cryptocurrencies to be property in the same class as stocks, bonds, and barter transactions.  As supremely ironic as this decision should be to those who know him, this provides perverse vindication for BitShares founder, <a href="/team/daniel-larimer.php">Daniel Larimer</a>, who <a href="http://letstalkbitcoin.com/is-bitcoin-overpaying-for-false-security/">coined the phrase Decentralized Autonomous Company</a> to describe systems like Bitcoin, and who has argued all along that the units issued by a distributed, token-issuing blockchain management system (cryptocurrency) are more accurately viewed as shares, and not as coins.

           <h2>Decentralized Autonomous Jedi Mind Tricks</h2>
           <h3>by Daniel Larimer & Charles Evans on March 20, 2014</h3>
           <p>
           In December David Johnston, one of the developers of Mastercoin and co-founder of cryptocurrency angel investor network, BitAngels, published <a href="https://github.com/DavidJohnstonCEO/DecentralizedApplications/blob/master/README.md">"The Emerging Wave of Decentralized Applications"</a> on github, in which he describes Bitcoin and next-generation systems—specifically, BitShares, Meshcoin, and Mastercoin—as 'Distributed Applications' as distinct from the <a href="http://letstalkbitcoin.com/is-bitcoin-overpaying-for-false-security/">original</a> Distributed Autonomous Corporations (DAC). Johnston argues that this new phrase is preferable because it avoids associations with regulated entities, like currency and corporate shares.  In today's blog entry we will refute this reasoning and explain in great detail the importance of the DAC metaphor.

           <p>
           As is always the case with new technology, the language often lacks words for the new concepts associated with the innovation, as we are forced to use existing words in strange new ways, as our ancestors did when faced with the ‘horseless carriage’ (automobile), ‘talking picture’ (movie), or ‘information superhighway’ (Internet). Thus, while it is true that words have meanings, it is equally true that a rose by any other name is still a rose.
           </p>
           <p>
           However one describes what a piece of software does, it does what it does; no more and no less, and no matter what natural language words one uses to describe it. If one truly wants to understand what Bitcoin, BitShares, Ethereum, Linux, or any other software does, one must analyze the source code. Nonetheless, some individuals seem to derive perverse delight in taking similes and analogies literally and pretending to find controversy where none exists. Whether this is playing Devil’s Advocate, impish trolling, or some form of narcissistic cry for attention, it can lead to economic harm to the party whose words are willfully misinterpreted.

           <h2>What is BitShares X</h2>
           <h3>by Charles Evans on March 7, 2014</h3>
           <p>
           BitShares X is a bank &amp; exchange implemented as a decentralized autonomous company (DAC).  In addition to having shares in the BitShares X DAC, the DAC has a additional layer for the creation of <a href="/faq/index.php#bitasset">BitAssets</a>, which have values that track gold, silver, dollars, or almost <i>anything</i> with a price.

           <p>
           Soon, the first round of BitShares (BTS) will be issued to holders of BitShares PTS
(originally known as ProtoShares). For those who may not be familiar, BitShares PTS 
was first launched by Invictus Innovations on November 5, 2013 with the promise of
providing PTS holders at least 10% of every future Decentralized Autonomous Company 
(DAC) created by Invictus Innovations.

           <p>
           Sometimes our suggestions that third-party developers should honor the BitShares Social Consensus sound a bit like Invictus is just making up a set of take-it-or-leave-it rules.  We are not.  What we are suggesting are more like Natural Economic Laws we have discovered that we are bound to follow as well.
           </p><p>
           Winning the favor of the BitShares PTS/AGS community is a Big Deal because owners of PTS and AGS already represent the lion’s share of informed early adopters of the concept of crypto-equities and Decentralized Autonomous Companies (DACs).  If you get these folks on your side, they can help you fine-tune your concept and spread the word once they understand what you have in mind.  And they will be the ones most likely to invest in your idea.  Everyone else in the world needs to be educated from scratch.

           <h2>DAC Revisited</h2>
           <h3>by Daniel Larimer on November, 2013</h3>
           <p>
Since <a href="http://bitshares.org/team/stanley-larimer.php">Stan Larimer</a> first published “<a title="Bitcoin and the Three Laws of Robotics" href="http://letstalkbitcoin.com/bitcoin-and-the-three-laws-of-robotics/">Bitcoin and the Three Laws of Robotics</a>” there have been many articles discussing the creation of Decentralized Autonomous Corporations (aka DACs).    <a href="https://bitcoinpresscenter.org/presscontact/vitalik-buterin">Vitalik Buterin</a> has published a <a href="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/7050/bootstrapping-a-decentralized-autonomous-corporation-part-i/">3-part series</a> discussing the bootstrapping of a DAC, interacting with the world, and Identity Corp.   Others, such as <a href="http://8btc.com">8BTC</a>, have started to  <a href="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/7827/the-pirates-of-8btc-implement-the-idea-of-distributed-autonomous-corporations/">talk about their systems as a DAC</a>.</p>
           <p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, the enthusiasm for DACs has led many people to jump the gun and start calling things a DAC that clearly are not while at the same time proposing new DACs that are not feasible.  As the original creator of the DAC metaphor I would like to add some clarity to the discussion that will help people design new DACs.

            <p>
You may not have considered it, but Bitcoin can be viewed as an unmanned company – or a Distributed Autonomous Corporation (DAC) if you prefer.  Unlike passive currencies, Bitcoin derives much of its tangible value by performing a trustworthy confidential fiduciary service. Essentially, it keeps private books for customer “checking” accounts and will transfer credits between accounts upon receipt of a properly signed “check”.

           <h3>by Daniel Larimer  September, 2013</h3>
           <p>
           If you have been following Bitcoin and crypto-currencies in general you will have probably seen the claim that miners provide computation power that secures the network. To compensate these miners for the security services they provide they earn mining rewards and transaction fees. The questions become, is there any rationale to justify how many resources are currently directed into ‘securing’ the network and how much ‘value’ is being provided in exchange for the so-called security provided?

           <p>
Who really owns your online identity? I can assure you that any ownership you perceive is an illusion and ultimately your online identity is not currently under your control. Chances are your identity is tied to your e-mail address and every service you sign up for uses email verification as the primary means of identification.
