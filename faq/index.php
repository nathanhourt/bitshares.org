             DAC stands for Decentralized Autonomous Company or previously Distributed Autonomous Corporation.  DACs are
             not legal entities and instead serve as a metaphor for describing how transparent, irreversable ledger systems such as Bitcoin
             operate.  DACs can have expenses (paying miners) and they can earn revenue (charging transaction fees).

             A crypto-equity is a more accurate description of what a crypto-currency is.  Bitcoin is first and foremost a crypto-equity, but when it
             is used as a medium of exchange, it becomes a crypto-currency.  In the same ways shares in Apple (AAPL) are first and foremost
             an equity, but if they became <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearer_share.asp">bearer shares</a> and started circulating 
             in barter transactions they could become a currency as well.

           A crypto-currency is a term coined to differenciate Bitcoin from other digital currencies such as Linden Dollars or egold. The defintion of crypto-currency as a digital medium of exchange is broad enough to cover BitShares; however, within the BitShares ecosystem we prefer to refer to systems such as Bitcoin and BitShares as a crypto-equity.

             A BIP is one billionth of the current share supply and is the fundamental unit of account in a DAC.  Given 8,000,000 initial shares, a
             BIP would be .008 shares. The total number of shares in circulation is constantly decreasing as dividends are
             paid from transaction fees.

             While the number of shares in your wallet doesn't change, the number of BIPs in your wallet is constantly growing and in this 
             way users have a better unit of account.   The user interface of all DACs should completely hide the underlying shares and
             instead display all balances in termps of BIPs and all transfers should also be specified in terms of BIPs.

		    <p>The critical difference is in the design of the relationship of the crypto-equity ("namecoins" or NMC for Namecoin, "nameshares", ".P2Pshares" or .P2P for .p2p) to the functionality of the network. We use the Distributed Autonomous Company metaphor to help describe how these two network reward their "shareholder" when it is able to provide value. This provides an incentive for engineers all around the globe to independently cooperate on maintaining the network with a narrowly defined goal and incentive mechanic.</p>
		    <ul>
		        <li>Namecoin issues new coins to miners as a reward for performing merged mining with the Bitcoin network. The namecoin supply is being inflated at nearly 30% per year for the next 40,000 blocks, then over 10% for the next four years. .p2p uses DPOS for significantly cheaper security, while domainshares only ever shrink in supply, when fees are destroyed as implicit dividends.</li>
		        <li>Namecoin attempts to service multiple namespaces at once, including non-TLD key-value records. Domainshares is highly specialized for servicing the .p2p TLD namespace. We believe this gives is more freedom to optimize around unforseen constraints in the future. The use case is the same as Namecoin's "d/" namespace.</li>
		        <li>Namecoin's name registration price is fixed at any given time and is independent of the name itself and implicit dividends are only paid when transaction fees are destroyed. Domainshares utilizes an auction-like mechanic to incentivize price discovery for names, making sure the final owner pays what it is actually worth. At least half of the final price will have gone to the network as dividends.</li>

		    Ethereum is an runtime environment on a blockchain - you can easily make a TLD just like .p2p in just a few lines of code. A simple name registration script is shown on the ethereum website:
		    
		    <pre>if tx.value < block.basefee * 200:
    stop
if contract.storage[tx.data[0]] or tx.data[0] < 100:
    stop
contract.storage[tx.data[0]] = tx.data[1]
			</pre>
		    
		    You can imagine completely mimicking .p2p's behavior in just a few hundred lines of code in this language. Allocating names on a blockchain is almost as basic as distributing shares and so we should expect to see namespace capabilities in practically every bitcoin 2.0 project.
		    
		    There are two tradeoffs to riding on general-purpose blockchains: one is that the blockchain developers cannot optimize the system around contraints relevant to this particular DAC, and the other is that the Ether unit of account does not reflect the success of any individual service and so there is no way for holders of the equity to profit from service performing its function well. The two systems also use different blockchain security models: bitshares DACs use DPOS while Ethereum uses a custom POW algorithm.

		       The original purpose of distinct TLD was to establish different rulesets for how the namespace is managed. The fact that it can be used to avoid name collisions is a secondary effect and an artifact of how traditional DNS is structured. AAPL.com and AAPL.org aren't just avoiding a collision - AAPL.org is utilizing the fact that it won't get sued on the .org namespace, while it would on the .com namespace. Sure you can make it so that two TLDs use the same ruleset and are on the same blockchain, but then the only thing that it accomplishes is to make an aesthetic difference between typing "yoursite-org / yoursite-com" and "yoursite.org / yoursite.com". One blockchain is one namespace, no matter how you slice it or mask it.
