      <h2>Decentralized Lending</h2>
      <p>
      Lending is one of the more difficult systems to decentralize because it generally
      involves matters of trust and credit worthiness.  These things typically require individual
      judgment and ultimatley accountability.
      </p>
      <p> 
      Ripple is the first system that has entered the scene that allows individuals to extend 
      credit to one other on a decentralized ledger system.  This ledger system facilitates 
      the settlement of debt among many parties, some of which may not know eachother directly.

         automatically ripple payments between strangers through a network of credit relaitonships.

         <p>
         Bitshares ME allows individuals to issue their own individual shares.  These shares can be used to
         represent their own IOUs that can then circulate.  This can be seen as a form of peer-to-peer 
         lending where the individual holding the IOU is extending credit to the issuer.
