      <h2>Decentralized Money</h2>
      <p>
      Money and currency are critical to our society and control over its issuance is
      a source of great power that is frequently abused.  Perhaps more than any other
      industry it is critical that integrity and transparency be enforced by decentralized
      systems.
      </p>
      <p>
      While many people get lost in never ending debates about what is or isn't money, we
      choose to recognize that anything can be used as money if enough people accept its
      use in commerce.  Certain things are easier to use than others, so perhaps the most 
      important factor when evaluating what makes a good money is considering its 
      ease of use.
      </p>
      <p>
      Generally speaking history has shown us that there are three classes of assets
      that can serve as money: commodities (gold/silver), bearer bonds (bank notes), 
      and bearer shares (stock in companies).  Commodities have the virtue of being 
      <a href="/faq/index.php#trustless">trustless</a> and potentially very stable in
      value.   Bearer bonds are normally tied to the price stability of commodities, but
      introduce the element of trust to the equation.  Bearer shares are rarely used as
      money unless you consider national currencies such as the dollar to be stock in 
      the United States government.   
      </p>
      <p>
      In the digital world, we are restricted to bearer bonds and shares because no one
      has figured out a way to send gold over the Internet.   We have three different
      approaches being tried in the industry right now.  Bitcoin is promoting the
      use of its shares as money, Ripple is promoting the use of uncollateralized 
      bearer bonds with a centralized issuer, and <span style="color:#9ce936;">bit</span><span style="color:#009df6;">shares</span> X 
      is using collateralized bearer bonds where the 'network' is the issuer.
      </p>
      <p>
      Each of these approaches has their place and in time the market will identify
      the best form of money to use.

         Bitcoin was the first successful decentralized currency that
         marketed its shares as coins.  The shares in Bitcoin have
         many of the desirable properties of money and have proven
         very useful for all manner of commerce on the internet.

         <p>
         <a href="/faq/index.php#BitUSD">BitUSD</a> is a digital asset that 
         has all of the properties of Bitcoin with the price stability of the 
         dollar.  It is created by decentralized banks such as <a href="/banking">bitshares X</a>. 
         There are many different types of <a href="/faq/index.php#BitAsset">BitAssets</a> such
         as <a href="/faq/index.php#BitAsset">BitGold</a> that may prove more competitive
         than BitUSD given the inflation of the US dollar.

         The Ripple network allows gateways to issue digital bearer bonds denominated in
         any asset class.  These digital bearer bonds are redeemable at specific exchanges. 
         Alternatively, Ripple can allow businesses to trade credit with one other as
         a form of digital money.
