  <center><h1>DANIEL LARIMER</h1></center>
  <center><h3>Founder</h3></center>

  <h2>A Passion for Freedom—Via Decentralization</h2>
  <p>
  Not all that deep and hidden in his
  entrepreneurial heart of hearts, Daniel
  Larimer is a philosopher and a dreamer,
  identities he readily attests to in discussing
  an approach to life, study and work that
  has placed him in the forefront of the
  Bitcoin world, where he is known within
  its inner circles as “Father of the DAC.”
  (He originated the idea of the “decentralized
   autonomous company.”)
  </p>

  <p>
  As founder of bitshares, an
  utterly innovative “crypto-equity” platform
  that he founded in 2013,
  Larimer’s passion is bound not so much by
  building successful companies, though that
  is all well and good, but by having those
  companies do nothing less than help change
  the world. He aims to do so under the
  guiding vision of a radically decentralized
  economy that reflects his own company’s
  mission to pursue free markets that ensure
  “life, liberty and property for all.”
  </p>

  <p>
  Larimer is a Colorado native who spent
  his formative years in Florida and
  Virginia, the latter serving as his home
  base since graduating in computer science
  from Virginia Tech in 2003. Having
  learned computer programming from his
  father when still in elementary school,
  he turned an almost in-born techy/
  entrepreneurial bent into a business
  venture fresh out of college, when he
  joined a handful of buddies to launch a
  virtual reality company.
  </p>

  <p>
  All the while, he was pursuing nothing
  less than what he unabashedly calls
  “the pursuit of truth about everything—
  I’ve always wanted to know what’s going
  on in the world and how things work.”
  Encounters with the Ron Paul presidential
  campaigns stimulated an intellectual
  odyssey into the depths of libertarianism,
  a passion that informs his unique fusion
  of economics, innovation, politics and
  the common good.
  </p>

  <p>
  “I believe whole-heartedly in voluntary
  associations and moving beyond a
  contract society where I’m going to get you
  to do X, Y or Z or I’ll get the government
  to point a gun at you,” he says. “Contracts
  always come down to government force.
  All that just drives costs and misery up.
  I want to do business on a handshake and
  make reputation primary, because if your
  reputation is damaged it’s the worst thing
  that can happen, and your business suffers.
  It’s never about coercion, but about the
  Golden Rule with a slight twist: ‘Don’t do
  unto others as you don’t want them to do
  unto you.’”
  </p>

  <p>
  He points out that Bitcoin operates on
  basically the same premise, where, he
  says, “No one delivers anything by fiat.”
  “Satoshi Nakamoto,” the pseudonym for
  the developer of Bitcoin, whom he soon
  began regularly communicating with
  before developing his own twist on
  Nakamoto’s blockchain technology in the
  form of BitShares.
  </p>

  <p>
  “I was trying to figure out how to create
  a decentralized bank,” he says, “so I had an
  idea and put out a bounty on the Internet,
  for which I’d pay $1,000 to anyone who
  could convince me not to put my life
  savings into it. No one really could, but
  I paid it anyway, because there had been a
  lot of good questions raised. Then a few
  days later, I solved why my idea wouldn’t
  work! I was really sad, but then on June 2,
  2013—I remember the day—it came to
  me. I discovered the key that led to one of
  the BitShares businesses we’re building
  called BitSharesX—a decentralized exchange
  that combines the benefits of Bitcoin with
  the price stability of the dollar. That has
  continued to lead to more exciting uses of
  our technology.
  </p>

  <p>
  “Will I get where I want all this to go
  in my lifetime? I don’t know, but this is the
  first step.”
