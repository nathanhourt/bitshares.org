      <h3>Decentalized Voting</h3>
      <p>
      Transparently honest elections are something that we could only dream of prior to the
      invention of decentralized transaction ledgers and technologies such as <a href="http://zerocoin.org/">Zerocoin</a>. 
      With the latest ideas behind bitshares Voice it will soon be possible to have ellections
      where all voters are verified, they can cast their votes in an anonymous manner and yet also
      change their vote at any time with out any ability to manipulate the count.
      </p>
      <p>
      Decentralized voting has the potential to make scientific polling obsolete and give third party canidates
      an opportunity to build a base in a transparent way without the media telling us who has
      a chance.  If a candidate fails to garner enough support you can always change your vote
      at the last minute, but early on you can express your true opinions without fear of
      wasting your vote.
      </p>
      <p>
      Beyond national politics, decentralized voting systems offer the potential to replace
      third-party election companies which are often hired to run private elections for
      for organizations like the Bitcoin Foundation.
